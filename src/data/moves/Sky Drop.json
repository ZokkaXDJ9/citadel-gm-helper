While charging this move, both the User and Target are out of range, with the exception of the attacks Gust, Thunder, Twister, Sky Uppercut, Hurricane, Smack Down and Thousand Arrows. The target is still able to target the user or self while in the air, but counts as Flinched (even if the target is immune to Flinch). Flying Type Pokemon are immune to the Damage of this move. A target greater than 200kgs is immune to this move completely. This Move fails and is canceled by the effects of the move Gravity.",
